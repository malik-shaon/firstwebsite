     <h1>What is Hypertext</h1>
     <p>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</p>
      <p>  Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965</p>

      <p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and sound , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</p>

      <p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p>
